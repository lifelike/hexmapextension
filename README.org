** Introduction
This is an extension for creating hex grids in [[http://www.inkscape.org][Inkscape.]] It can also be used to
make brick patterns of staggered rectangles.

You need Inkscape 1.0 or later installed. Older versions of Inkscape
are NOT supported (you can use older versions of this extensions
if you must create some hexgrids using older Inkscape versions,
or just upgrade Inkscape).
** Installing
To install the extension you need to copy *hexmap.inx*
and *hexmap.py*
into the *extensions* folder (directory) of your
Inkscape installation. In Linux this will typically be
*/usr/share/inkscape/extensions*
or *~/.config/inkscape/extensions*.
If Inkscape was installed on Linux from [[https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.inkscape.Inkscape][Flatpak]]
the path is more likely *~/.var/app/org.inkscape.Inkscape/config/inkscape/extensions/*.
In Windows it will be something like
*C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions*. After (re)starting
Inkscape you should now have *Boardgames* submenu in the
Extensions menu, and in that an entry for running
*Generate Hex Map*.
** Running The Extension
Creates a grid of hexagons over the document. Up to six layers
are created:

- *Hex Grid* The hexgrid itself. Each hex border is a separate line object.
- *Hex Centerdot* A small circle in the center of each hex, as is needed for many games.
- *Hex Fill* One polygon object for each hex. Can be used to quickly add a color or pattern to hexes.
- *Hex Coordinates* The coordinate label of each hex. The format of each label is controlled by parameters in the effect's dialog window.
- *Hex Corners* Corners/Vertices  of each hex only. Use as alternative to the normal hexgrid if you prefer a map with less visible grid. Some people call these caltrops.
- *Hex Circles* Circles the size of each hex.
** User Guide
There is a separate [[https://github.com/lifelike/hexmapextension/blob/master/USER%20GUIDE.md][User Guide]] document with much more information and help
that is recommended reading for anyone about to use this extension or that
is considering to use it.
